# Image-Perturbation-and-Phishing-Logos
Noisy Logos and their ability to avoid detection by Anti-Phishing tools that utilize AI Image Classifiers. Code and Final Report from Human Factors in Cybersecurity (CS 496, University of TN)  
*Report is located in ./"The Ineffectiveness of Anti-Phishing Tools on Perturbed Logos.pdf"*

## Code
Contains the Python/Pytorch file that generates noise for logos.

## Logos
Contains Two Groups of Logos for testing: 
### Control Group
This contains logos that are either clean or clearly modified.
### Epsilon Group
This contains logos that have varying levels of epsilon (additional noise). Used to test the human perceptibility of noisy logos
